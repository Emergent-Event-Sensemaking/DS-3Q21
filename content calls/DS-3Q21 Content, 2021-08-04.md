## Questions

- Is this just about Delta?
- Who are experts that seem trustworthy?
	- Dr. John Roberts
	- Dr. Osterholm
- Who are experts that don't seem trustworthy?
	- Dr. Monica
- How is [[Delta variant]] different?
- What's different between being Unvaccinated and Vaccinated?
- What does "95% effective" (or whatever) mean with COVID-19 vaccines?
	- mild vs. severe
	- hospitalization
	- deaths
- What are the various vaccines? (11:31)
	- Where in the world were they deployed?
	- "sweet spot 80 days" (11:31) need source
- I have a model of how infection works (11:33)...
	- I (Pete) wish for a good illustrated model of infection and immune response
		- which reminds me there's a pretty good twitter thread on it to go find
- Tell me about aerosols vs. droplet infection (11:36)
- How long does SARS-CoV-2 survive in aerosols? Is there a difference between Delta and previous variants?
- What's the 1000x thing about Delta? (1000x viral load... what does that mean?)
- How effective are different kinds of masks?
	- cloth
	- surgical
	- N95 / KN95
	- others?
- What's the different between N95 masks and KN95 masks?
- What's the swiss cheese / holes diagram?

It will be helpful to collect a set of people on "the socials" whom we find trustworthy.
This would help me curate my own assumptions of whom to trust.


## Notes

(11:20) As we (in US) send people back to schools and offices, we didn't set up better air filtration.
- story about Johanne's dentist who set up air filtration _per chair_ in February 2020

(11:21) Conway Mega Air Filtration systems on Amazon ($177 last week, $250 this week)

(11:25 ish) story about Israel, US, UK 

## How is Delta variant different?

- Delta is (evolved) to bind (is there another word?) better to human cells
- don't know about when it's severe 
- patients:
	- younger
	- sicker faster
- death rate: not sure, but not necessarily different
- if you're sick with wild-type, not everybody in a household gets it; with Delta, everyone in a household gets it
- can catch it
	- outside, 24 inches apart, 10 seconds

- 30% protection for first vaccine dose, 

johanne stats (11:18) about kids

we had lockdowns during wild type surges; is that part of it?

that cytokine? storm was reported very early on. yes?

Jerry Michalski

yup

kids and schools have always been efficient contagion vectors, right? :)

Coway, not Conway, right? :)

Yes, Coway. sorry, my dsylexia strikes again!

Here is a post from WaPo on the delta variant - they say they are providing it free of charge - I also posted it to the OGM mailing list: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/07/delta-variant-covid/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/07/delta-variant-covid/)

where is that list of whom to avoid?

you can correct details in the chat... :)

Cool!

my shared view isn't showing anything new, and I don't think it's a local issue :) maybe stop the screenshare?

Michael Osterholm, UMN faculty/epidemiologist & global COVID consultant; [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/)

I've added Osterholm and Campbell under Best Covid Information Sources. who else deserves to be there?

Ken Homer

11:34 AM

My sound keeps dropping out - I am going to log off and rejoin to see if that fixes it... Pete, keep an eye out for me - thanks!

Another question: What is my risk, as a fully vaxxed person, of a breakthrough infection and how serious might it be?

Jerry Michalski

11:36 AM

aerosols stay in the air for hours

lovely German series about the history of medicine: both seasons of Charité

Ken Homer

11:37 AM

Thanks Jerry! I have it in my queue but have not watched it yet

Jerry Michalski

11:37 AM

in the first season, disinfection plays a starring role

they're really good

second one is called Charité at war

From Johns Hopkins site: Are the current vaccines effective against the Delta variant? Yes. Very effective, in fact. Two shots of the Pfizer vaccine are 88% effective against the Delta variant in preventing symptomatic disease. That compares with 94% effectiveness against the Alpha variant. It’s a little lower, but it is still very high protectiveness for any vaccine. It’s far higher than the effective rates of the vaccines developed against seasonal flu. We would need to worry if the effective

...without killing all the hosts quickly, which causes the fuel system to burn out

Ken Homer

11:47 AM

Pete - what can you tell us about KN95 masks - are they effective?

Bill Anderson

11:48 AM

I added something to the hackmd page

thanks, bill, added to the obsidian notes

re: 1000x viral load - I am looking at a post from WaPo and here is a direct quote: There is still limited data on whether delta is more likely to result in severe illness. Public Health England (PHE) found that the variant may be associated with a higher risk of hospitalization, and some early research from Scotland suggests that the risk of hospitalization with covid-19 from the delta variant is about twice the risk from the alpha variant — with unvaccinated people at the greatest risk.

and Delta+, right?

How does the deeper entrenchment on the part of anti-vaxxers and those who claim public health guidelines infringe on their individual rights impact us in our sensemaking?

A number of airlines installed air filtration systems to make flying safer...

Stephan Kreutzer

11:56 AM

air conditioning/filtration is probably the single most impactful factor indoors we can do something about

Bill Anderson11:57 AM

air filtration ++ is the tip of the infrastructure iceberg here in the USA

J Benham11:59 AM

Filtration??

Filtration-system??

Stephan Kreutzer12:00 PM

Is air filtration actually a thing and/or effective?

Jerry Michalski12:00 PM

especially a young human

Stephan Kreutzer12:00 PM

at my place at least certain types of air condition systems are not allowed to be turn, others are

You12:01 PM

air filtration works, yes, with good enough filters

Stephan Kreutzer12:01 PM

+to be turned on

Jerry Michalski12:01 PM

I'd love to shift the "great article!" posts over to Mattermost... :)

You12:02 PM

there's a big difference in filters; in masks, cloth masks and surgical masks are ok for a short time, but MUCH less effective than N95
