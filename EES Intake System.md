# EES Intake System

This is an evolving draft description of a system to manage EES intake.  This might be the component we've been calling "the firehose" or "Stage A", with more emphasis on the Evidence Database

## Roles

- Evidence Collector (human)
- Investigator (human)
- Intake Bot (bot)
- Curator (human)
- Narrator (human)

## Data

- Exhibit
- Intake Stream
- Evidence Database
- Short Narrative - simple sentence that helps classify this exhibit; not meant as a complete statement of the narrative

## User Interfaces

- Dashboard

## Actions

- Sensemaking

## Activities

Evidence Collectors create Exhibits within Intake Streams.

Intake Bots process Exhibits by annotating and storing Exhibits in the Evidence Database.  Intake Bots add additional metadata and data to the Exhibit.

Investigators review the exhibit and do initial Sensemaking. Investigators assign the Exhibit to Narratives, giving a brief explanation for the assignment to each Short Narrative.  An Investigator creates a new Short Narrative if the Exhibit demonstrates a Short Narrative which does not already exist in the Evidence Database.
