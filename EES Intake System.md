- Curator (human)
- Narrator (human)

- Exhibit
- Intake Stream

## Activities

Evidence Collectors create Exhibits within Intake Streams.

Intake Bots process Exhibits by annotating and storing Exhibits in the Evidence Database.  Intake Bots add additional metadata and data to the Exhibit.

Investigators review the exhibit and do initial Sensemaking. Investigators assign the Exhibit to Narratives, giving a brief explanation for the assignment to each Short Narrative.  An Investigator creates a new Short Narrative if the Exhibit demonstrates a Short Narrative which does not already exist in the Evidence Database.
