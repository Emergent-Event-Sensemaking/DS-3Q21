# Emergent Event Sensemaking, DS-3Q21

Hey infovores and sensemakers, let's play a (serious) game.

Not for entertainment, but for practice, because we need to learn to do this better for the next time.  (Er, times.)

This is a continuation of the "Emergent Event Sensemaking" (EES) inquiry, which stems from a guess that we need to figure out how to rapidly make sense of lots of information, lots of it conflicting, in the face of emergent events, such as 9/11, or COVID-19 in spring 2020, or the GameStop short squeeze -- or, let's say, the Delta surge of Q3 2021.

I am about a month late getting the "Delta Surge 3Q 2021" (DS-3Q21 ) edition going, but we still have a few months of confusion, drama, illness, and death ahead of us, so I don't think it's _too_ late to start.

The presenting problem EES tries to solve is that while there _are_ experts, and lots of information, it's hard to tell **who** the trustworthy experts are, and what information is signal, rather than noise.  EES should deploy tools, processes, and sensemaking to collaboratively refine raw material into continuously improving knowledge products.

For DS-3Q21, all I'm hoping for is starting to build a better front end to the refinery process: more raw material, and the start of some tools and processes that start to refine it.  Then, over time, we get better from there, maybe in time for the next big emergent event.

The DS-3Q21 questions:

- Can we create a collaborative mega-infostream / firehose / river?
- Can we add refinery processes (metadata, social filtering) to the firehose?
- Can we improve a vision for further refinement, to use in the next emergent event?

Having actually useful knowledge products this month and next is an important, but not primary goal.  (Some participating individuals or organizations may have that as their primary goal, though; there are still deaths to prevent and better lives to be had.)

The starter collaborative firehose tools I have:

Two CSC Mattermost channels, one for EES in general, and a specific DS-3Q21 content channel.  (Mattermost is open source software that's much like Slack, and I run an instance, CSC, where a little over a hundred people from various groups are subscribed.)

One Factr stream.  Social network for organizing and sharing knowledge. This one is new to me, but I've befriended one of the co-founders and the director of operations, and they're great folks.

One Massive Wiki.  My idea is that raw ore goes in either or both Mattermost and Factr, and the wiki helps start to organize the information, and meta-organize the collaboration.  We'll see what happens!
